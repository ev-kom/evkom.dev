# Hello!

I'm Egor, a Java developer who likes to do web development once in a while.

This website was built with [React95 NEXT.js template](https://github.com/React95/nextjs-template), React95 is a component library inspired by the Windows 95 UI design.

Shoutout to [Janne Koivisto's portfolio website](https://janneilkka.com/) I accidentally stumbled upon that inspired me to build this website.
